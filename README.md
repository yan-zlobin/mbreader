#Welcome to Magic Book Reader!

Magic Book Reader is the program for reading and storing in the library of electronic books. Currently only fb2-format. In future versions are planned epub and comics.

Magic Book Reader uses GObject, GTK+ 3, libxml2, libzip and sqlite. Pango is used to draw the reading pane.
